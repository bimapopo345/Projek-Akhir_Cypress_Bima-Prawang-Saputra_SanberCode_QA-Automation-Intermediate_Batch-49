# Cypress Automation Project
=====================================

## Project Description
This project is an automation testing framework built using Cypress, a popular testing framework for web applications. The project is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features.

The project automates tests for a sample web application, specifically testing login functionality, adding products to cart, and logging out. The tests are written in a way that is easy to read and maintain, with clear descriptions of each test.

The project uses Cypress's built-in features, such as commands, plugins, and support files, to make the testing process more efficient and organized.
